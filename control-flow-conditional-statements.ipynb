    "## Logical Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous lessons, you used comparison operators, which allow you to compare values such as checking whether one value is greater than another (e.g. `<`, `>`). You also used assignment operators (e.g. `+=`), which allow you to set a variable to a new value based on an arithmetic operation or some other calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will learn about another type of operator: logical. In conditional statements, logical operators are very useful for checking for multiple conditions as well as creating combinations of conditions to control the flow of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `and` to provide multiple conditions that all have to be met before executing code\n",
    "* `or` to provide multiple conditions, of which only one has to be met before executing code\n",
    "* `not` to execute code only if the stated condition is not met (note: you can use `not` in combination with `and` or `or` to check whether multiple conditions are not met)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will use these logical operators to write conditional statements that determine whether a specific combination of conditions is met before executing code. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Glob Package\n",
    "\n",
    "The `glob` package in `Python` is very useful for creating lists of directory and file names on your computer. It contains a module also called `glob` that provides this functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can use `glob.glob(\"path/*\")` to get a list of all items in a directory, and assign this list to a variable called `filelist`:"
