    "## Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lesson introducing DRY code, you learned that conditional statements provide you with the ability to control when or how code is executed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This can be very useful for checking whether a certain condition exists before the code begins to execute, as you may want to only execute certain code lines when certain conditions are met.   \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, conditional statements can be used to check that a certain variable or file exists before code is executed, or to execute more code if some criteria is met, such as a calculation resulting in a specific value. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of a conditional statement is defined through the use of `if` and `else`. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    print(\"condition is true\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"condition not true\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When the condition following the `if` is met, then a certain code will execute. When that condition is not met, then the code following the `else` will execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Review these simple examples to see how the `if` and `else` are used to control which code lines are executed."
